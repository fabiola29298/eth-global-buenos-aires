can be complex in code. If you prefer your EVVM to have multiple pay functions, 
please change the name of the document from EvvmLegacy.sol to Evvm.sol and verify 
that the services have something similar to this instead of pay.

 * @title EVVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine Virtualization) Core Contract
 * @author Mate labs
 * @notice Core payment processing and token management system for the EVVM ecosystem
 * @dev This contract serves as the central hub for:
 *      - Multi-token payment processing with signature verification
 *      - Staker reward distribution and incentive mechanisms
 *      - Cross-chain bridge functionality (Fisher Bridge)
 *      - Balance management across the EVVM ecosystem
 *      - Integration with NameService for identity-based payments
 *      - Treasury integration for privileged balance operations
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Synchronous and asynchronous payment processing with nonce management
 * - Staker privilege system with enhanced rewards and transaction processing benefits
 * - Multi-recipient payment batching (payMultiple, dispersePay)
 * - Administrative payment distribution (caPay, disperseCaPay)
 * - Proxy pattern support with delegatecall fallback for upgradeability
 * - Cross-chain asset bridging capabilities through Fisher Bridge
 * - Deflationary tokenomics with era-based reward halving mechanism
 * - Treasury-controlled balance management for minting and burning operations
 * 
 * Payment Types:
 * - `payNoStaker_*`: Standard payments for non-stakers with basic functionality
 * - `payStaker_*`: Enhanced payments for Principal Token stakers with priority fee rewards
 * - `payMultiple`: Batch payments to multiple recipients with individual success tracking
 * - `dispersePay`: Single-source multi-recipient distribution with signature verification
 * - `caPay`: Administrative token distribution for smart contracts
 * - Treasury functions: Direct balance manipulation for authorized operations
 * 
 * Economic Model:
 * - Principal Token as principal token with reward distribution system
 * - Era-based reward halving when supply thresholds are reached
 * - Staker incentives through transaction processing rewards
 * - Random bonus rewards for triggering era transitions
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - Signature-based transaction authorization with EIP-191 compliance
 * - Dual nonce system: synchronous (sequential) and asynchronous (custom)
 * - Executor validation for delegated transaction processing
 * - Balance verification before transfers to prevent overdrafts
 * - Time-delayed governance for critical upgrades (30-day implementation, 1-day admin)
 * - Access control through admin and treasury authorization
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - NameService: Identity resolution for username-based payments
 * - Staking Contract: Staker status management and reward distribution
 * - Treasury Contract: Privileged balance operations and token management
 * - Implementation Contract: Proxy pattern for contract upgradeability
 * 
 * @custom:version 1.0.0
 * @custom:testnet This contract is deployed on testnet for development and testing
 * @custom:security Time-delayed governance, signature verification, access control
 * @custom:upgrade-pattern Transparent proxy with admin-controlled implementation

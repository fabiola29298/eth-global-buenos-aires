 * @title Staking Mate contract
 * @author Mate labs
 * @notice This contract manages the staking mechanism for the EVVM ecosystem
 * @dev Handles presale staking, public staking, and service staking with time locks and signature verification
 *
 * The contract supports three types of staking:
 * 1. Golden Staking: Exclusive to the goldenFisher address
 * 2. Presale Staking: Limited to 800 presale users with 2 staking token limit
 * 3. Public Staking: Open to all users when enabled
 * 4. Service Staking: Allows smart contracts to stake on behalf of users
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Time-locked unstaking mechanisms
 * - Signature-based authorization
 * - Integration with EVVM core contract for payments and rewards
 * - Estimator integration for yield calculations
